* Select Java, not Java EE
* Create new project, and name it to Game1
* After it creates folder structure, right click on src, and select New --> select "class"
* when the class window appears, you will want to name your Package.  This case, I will name mine com.richardjoo.game1
* and on the name field, type Game since this will be the main class.
